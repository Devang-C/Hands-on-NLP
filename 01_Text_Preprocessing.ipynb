    "Text preprocessing is a crucial step while building NLP solutions and applications. Once we acquire some data for our project, the first thing we need to perform is to do text preprocessing to make sure that our data is suitable for input to our machine learning / deep learning model. It makes sure that the data is consistent, does not contain unecessary things and data is as per the project requirements\n",

Paul Lukas\\' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like \"dressed-up midgets\" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother\\'s slow awakening to what\\'s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they\\'d all be \"up\" for this movie.'"
